Build 637 notes:

> - Require that users agree to terms (EULA)

This was stated on the signup page, but now requires the Terms of Use be viewed and explicitly agreed to.

> and these terms must make it clear that there is no tolerance for objectionable content or abusive users

The "PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES" section of the Terms Of Use covers this.

> - A method for filtering objectionable content

Long-pressing any post or photo will now bring up a menu with "Hide" as the first option.

> - A mechanism for users to flag objectionable content  The developer must act on objectionable content reports within 24 hours by removing the content and ejecting the user who provided the offending content

And "Report" is the second item on that menu, which will send us an email with the offending content's ID to be removed and ejected within 24 hours.

> - A mechanism for users to block abusive users

And "Block User" is the third item on that menu, which will hide all UGC from that user and blank out their space on leaderboards.

> - Can users view other users’ locations?

No.

> - How does your app obtain users’ consent for the leaderboard?

Consent for use of all user provided data is granted in the "CONTRIBUTION LICENSE" section of the Terms of Use.
